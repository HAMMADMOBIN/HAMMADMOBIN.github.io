title: "Satellite Image Feature Detection"
excerpt: "In this Project, our project is with 1km x 1km satellite images in both 3-band and 16-band formats. Our goal is to
detect and classify the types of objects found in these regions. 3- and 16-bands images There are two types of
imagery spectral content provided in this competition. The 3-band images are the traditional RGB natural color
images. The 16-band images contain spectral information by capturing wider wavelength channels.
By using a U-Net Architecture. <br/><img src='1.png'>"

Abstractâ€”The proliferation of satellite imagery has given us a
radically improved understanding of our planet. It has enabled
us to better achieve everything from mobilizing resources during
disasters to monitoring effects of global warming. What is often
taken for granted is that advancements such as these have relied
on labeling features of significance like building footprints and
roadways fully by hand or through imperfect semi-automated
methods. This project report is an analysis and implementation
of a kernel that was published for the DSTL Satellite Imagery
Feature Detection challenge run by Kaggle [2]. The approach is
based on an adaptation of fully convolutional neural network for
multispectral data processing using UNET and RESNET.
