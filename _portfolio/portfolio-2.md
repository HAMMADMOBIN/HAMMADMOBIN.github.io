Abstractâ€”The proliferation of satellite imagery has given us a
radically improved understanding of our planet. It has enabled
us to better achieve everything from mobilizing resources during
disasters to monitoring effects of global warming. What is often
taken for granted is that advancements such as these have relied
on labeling features of significance like building footprints and
roadways fully by hand or through imperfect semi-automated
methods. This project report is an analysis and implementation
of a kernel that was published for the DSTL Satellite Imagery
Feature Detection challenge run by Kaggle [2]. The approach is
based on an adaptation of fully convolutional neural network for
multispectral data processing using UNET and RESNET.
