I am a graduated student from the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (FAST) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (2016-2020). Now I work as a Software Engineer at Reboot Technologies Pvt. Limited (Trafix LLC) (Fintech Solution Provider). My keen interest is in Machine Learning models and Probabilistic Programming. 

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills through various projects and internships. My final year project, which focused on utilizing software development methodologies and natural language processing techniques to solve problems within the freelance job market, was particularly rewarding. Under the guidance of  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RgWKBwUAAAAJ">(Dr. Jawwad Ahmed Shamsi)</a>, I developed a name entity recognizer approach that sought to address the challenges faced by job applicants in the freelance industry.


In addition to my specific experience in natural language processing, my research interests lie in the broader field of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Theory of Optimization and Probabilistic Graphical Models. I am particularly interested in the use of probabilistic modeling and statistical learning to understand large datasets and to make predictions based on those datasets. Through internships at Deloitte and Jubilee Life Insurance, I had the opportunity to apply these concepts in a professional setting as a data analyst, where I used regression models for predictive analytics.

Furthermore, I also keen to explore more in the field of MLOPS, Reinforcement Learning and how it can be used in financial institutions such as banks, asset management firms, or hedge funds. I am excited to continue learning and growing in these areas and am eager to work with an organization that will provide opportunities for me to utilize my technical skills and abilities.
