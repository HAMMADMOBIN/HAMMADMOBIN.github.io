I am a graduated student from the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (FAST) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (2016-2020). Now I work as a Software Engineer at Trafix LLC (Fintech Solution Provider). My keen interest is in Machine Learning models and Probabilistic Programming. I have an interest in research that will allow me to utilize my problem-solving skills and seek a challenging career with a progressive organization that provides an opportunity to capitalize on my technical skills & abilities in the field of information technology

During my undergraduate years, I completed my Final Year Project by using Software Development Methodologies and Natural Language Processing techniques to solve them and bring the Freelance environment job applicant problem by using the Name entity recognizer approach. Our Final Year Project is advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RgWKBwUAAAAJ">(Dr. Jawwad Ahmed Shamsi)</a>

My research interest is in Computer Vision, Machine learning, and Probabilistic Graphical Models. In which by using probabilistic modeling and statistical learning, we can understand large coupled with the availability of large training datasets, which has led to remarkable progress in computer vision. I did my internship at Deloitte and Jubilee Life Insurance as a Data Analyst in which I used regression models for predictive analytics. I also have an interest in the MLOPS and Reinforcement Learning in finance, especially in financial institutions such as banks, asset management firms, or hedge funds.
